# State Management Patterns

This document provides a detailed look into the state management strategy for the Webhook Chat Dashboard, explaining the rationale behind the chosen patterns.

## Core Philosophy

Our state management philosophy is to keep things simple, predictable, and scalable. We adhere to the following principles:
1.  **Lift State Up:** State is held by the nearest common ancestor of all components that need it.
2.  **Prefer Local State:** State that is only used by a single component (or a small, isolated group of components) should remain local to that component.
3.  **Unidirectional Data Flow:** Data flows down from parent to child components via props, and children communicate with parents via callback functions.

## Global State in `App.tsx`

The `App.tsx` component serves as the root container for our application's "global" state. This includes data that needs to be accessed or modified by multiple, otherwise unrelated components.

-   **`view`**: Controls which main page (`Dashboard`, `ModuleView`, `Settings`) is visible. It's managed in `App.tsx` because the `Header` needs to change it, and the main content area needs to react to it.
-   **`apiKeys`**: The user's API keys. This state is managed here so it can be passed to the `Settings` page for editing and to all feature modules for making authenticated API calls.
-   **`modules`**: The array of all user-created webhook modules. This is persisted to `localStorage`.
-   **`chatSessions`, `generatedImages`, `generatedVideos`, `generatedMusic`, `aiSearchResults`**: These arrays hold all user-generated content and history, persisted to `localStorage` via the `useLocalStorage` hook. They serve as the single source of truth for each feature's history view.
-   **`imageJobs`, `videoJobs`, `musicJobs`**: These arrays manage the state of active generation tasks. They are not persisted as they represent in-progress work, but they are managed globally in `App.tsx` to allow for features like the global `JobStatusIndicator` in the header and the recent activity feed on the home page.

**Pros:** This approach is simple to understand and debug, as all major state transitions happen in one place.
**Cons:** It can lead to "prop drilling," where props are passed down through multiple layers of components. For the current application size, this is manageable.

## Local Component State

We use local state via the `useState` hook for data that is not needed elsewhere in the application. This encapsulation makes components more reusable and easier to reason about.

-   **`CreateModuleModal.tsx`**: Manages the `name` and `webhookUrl` form inputs locally. This state is only relevant to the modal itself and is passed up to `App.tsx` via a callback only upon form submission.
-   **`ModuleView.tsx`**: Manages the current `input` in the message bar and the `isLoading` status. This UI state is specific to the chat view and does not need to be known by other parts of the app.
-   **`Settings.tsx`**: Manages `localKeys` to track form changes. This prevents re-rendering the entire application on every keystroke in the settings form and only updates the global state when the user explicitly clicks "Save".

## State Persistence with `useLocalStorage`

To enhance user experience, critical state like modules, API keys, and content history must persist across browser sessions. This is achieved with the `useLocalStorage` custom hook.

**How it works:**
-   It acts as a wrapper around `useState`.
-   On initialization, it tries to read the value from `window.localStorage`. If no value is found, it uses the provided `initialValue`.
-   It uses a `useEffect` hook that triggers whenever the state value changes. Inside the effect, it writes the new value to `localStorage`.
-   All interactions with `localStorage` are wrapped in `try...catch` blocks to handle potential browser security restrictions or storage limits gracefully.

This hook provides a clean, declarative, and reusable way to manage persisted state without cluttering our components with storage logic.

## Future Considerations

If the application grows significantly and prop drilling becomes a maintenance issue, we may consider adopting more advanced state management solutions:
-   **React Context API:** To provide global state to deeply nested components without explicitly passing props through every level of the component tree.
-   **State Management Libraries (e.g., Zustand, Redux):** For applications with highly complex and interdependent state. However, for this project's current scope, this would be an over-engineering.
